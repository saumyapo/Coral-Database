*Currently a work in progress to migrate the website off BU servers.*  

# Coral-Database
The website was created using data obtained Dr. John Finnerty's lab at BU.  

- Background on the work carried out by the lab :
  *  From 2014-2022 Finnerty’s lab has studied coral in the Caribbean (Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, Belize).
  *  Recent decades have shown significant decline in coral cover on reefs in the tropics due to climate change – with many species at risk of extinction.
  *  This longitudinal study of the coral means to better understand the ecosystem dynamics taking place.
  *  Lab is currently focused on species that are able to survive in multiple environments – the data focuses on mangrove corals.

- Background on the data used for the project:
  *  Data divided into two main categories: phenotypic and variant cell format data (VCF).
  *  Phenotypic :
     -  Year (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018).
     -  Size (length, width and height).
     -   Partial mortality (alive, dead/missing).
     -  Ecological volume (also natural log of volume).
     -  Location (4 different sites).
  *  VCF :
     -  Variants determined from 2bRAD sequencing.
     -  Performed on samples collected in 2018.
